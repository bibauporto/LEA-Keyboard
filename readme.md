## Background

The LEA Keyboard Layout is the result of experimenting with various layouts, including:

- **Colemak**: A significant improvement over QWERTY, but it sparked a search for an even more efficient layout.
- **Colemak-DH** (and other Colemak variants): Offered slight improvements, but some key placements, like **F**, **Y**, and **A**, could be further optimized.
- **Canary**: A fast and comfortable layout with **T** in a strong position and **A** on the right hand. However, **Y** and **V** placements weren’t ideal for English and Portuguese typing needs.
- **STRDY**: A highly efficient layout that could be the standard for English typing. However, **T** on the ring finger takes some adjustment.

## Modified Strdy - LEA Keyboard

### Key Modifications
- **M**: Moved to the right side. While this slightly increases the load on the right hand, it improves typing rolls, stabilizes the left hand, and facilitates combinations like "MAKE" (where **M** and **K** are close).
- **Q**: Moved back to the left hand. Common in Portuguese, **Q** also benefits English typing with this placement.
- **V**: Positioned for easy access and improved comfort.
- **J**: Optionally placed to the left of **F** to accommodate **Ç** for Portuguese typists (optional for English-only users).
